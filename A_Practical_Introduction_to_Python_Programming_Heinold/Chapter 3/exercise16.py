below is described how to find the date of Easter in any year. Despite its intimidating appearance, this is not a hard problem. Note that bxc is the floor function, which for positive numbers
just drops the decimal part of the number. For instance b3.14c = 3. The floor function is part
of the math module.
C = century (1900’s → C = 19)

Y = year (all four digits)
m = (15 + C − C/4-c − b 8C+13
25 c) mod 30
n = (4 + C − b C
4
c) mod 7
a = Y mod 4
b = Y mod 7
c = Y mod 19
d = (19c + m) mod 30
e = (2a + 4b + 6d + n) mod 7
Easter is either March (22+d +e) or April (d +e−9). There is an exception if d = 29 and e = 6.
In this case, Easter falls one week earlier on April 19. There is another exception if d = 28,
e = 6, and m = 2, 5, 10, 13, 16, 21, 24, or 39. In this case, Easter falls one week earlier on April
18. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and prints out the date of Easter in that
year
